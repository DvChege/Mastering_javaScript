# Mastering JavaScript Fundamentals

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of my JavaScript learning journey. It demonstrates essential JavaScript concepts, including **variables, conditionals, functions, loops, and DOM manipulation**. The goal is to create a fully functional, interactive web page using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

## 🎯 Features
The project covers the following:

### 1️⃣ JavaScript Basics
- Variable declarations using `let` and `const`
- Handling **user input**
- Conditional logic using `if...else`
- Outputting results via:
  - `console.log()`
  - Modifying webpage content dynamically

### 2️⃣ Functions — Reusability
- At least **2 custom functions** for tasks like:
  - Calculating totals
  - Formatting strings
  - Toggling webpage content
- Functions take inputs, process data, and return/display results

### 3️⃣ Loops — Repetition Power
- **`for` loop** example
- **`while` loop** example
- Looping through arrays, generating content, or creating countdowns

### 4️⃣ DOM Manipulation
- Selecting HTML elements using `document.getElementById()` and `querySelector()`
- Changing text and styles dynamically
- Listening for user events like clicks
- Creating and appending elements on the fly

If you want, I can also make the **index.html**, **style.css**, and **script.js** files so this README links to a working project instead of just being documentation. That way, it’s ready to submit.
